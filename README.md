##  How It Works

- **Extract Frames:**  
  - Run `extract_frames.py` to split each video into individual frame images based on the propmts.

- **Train LoRA Model:**  
  - Run `train_lora.py` to fine-tune the AnimateDiff model using the extracted frames.

- **Generate Videos:**  
  - Use `app.py` to run a Flask web server where you upload an image and choose an action to generate a video.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the needed packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```

## 🚀 Full Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository and set up the environment**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Julia264/money-leads-video-generator.git
cd money-leads-video-generator
python3 -m venv lora-env
source lora-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Upload Videos**
   - Place your `.mp4` or `.mov` videos inside `datasets/الحركات/`.

3. **Extract Frames**

```bash
python3 extract_frames.py
```

4. **Download and Prepare Models**
   - Download `mm_sd_v14.ckpt` and `mm_sd_v15.ckpt` and put them inside the `models/` folder.

5. **Train the LoRA model**

```bash
python3 train_lora.py
```

6. **Run the Web Application**

```bash
python3 app.py
```
- Access the app from your browser at: `http://localhost:8080`

## 📌 Notes

- **Frames Directory:** Make sure the `datasets/الحركات/` folder contains extracted frames before training.
- **GPU Recommended:** Training and generation require a CUDA-compatible GPU for speed.
- **Authentication:** HuggingFace login may be needed to download models.
